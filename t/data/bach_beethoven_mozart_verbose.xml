						<wTeaser><![CDATA[<b>Johann Sebastian Bach</b> (31 March 1685 &ndash; 28 July 1750) was a German composer and organist whose sacred and secular works for choir, orchestra, and solo instruments drew together the strands of the Baroque period and brought it to its ultimate maturity. Although he introduced no new forms, he enriched the prevailing German style with a robust contrapuntal technique, an unrivalled control of harmonic and motivic organisation in composition for diverse instrumentation, and the adaptation of rhythms and textures from abroad, particularly Italy and France.]]></wTeaser>

He was one of the most prominent composers of the classical period, and is called by some the \"Father of the Symphony\" and \"Father of the String Quartet\". <br />A life-long citizen of Austria, Haydn spent much of his career as a court musician for the wealthy Hungarian Esterházy family on their remote estate. Isolated from other composers and trends in music until the later part of his long life, he was, as he put it, \"forced to become original\".<br />During his lifetime, the composer was always known as <b>Joseph Haydn</b>.

						<wTeaser><![CDATA[<b>Joseph-Maurice Ravel</b> (March 7, 1875 &ndash; December 28, 1937) was a French composer and pianist of Impressionist music known especially for the subtlety, richness, and poignancy of his melodies, orchestral and instrumental textures and effects. Much of his piano music, chamber music, vocal music and orchestral music have become staples of the concert repertoire. <br />Ravel's piano compositions, such as <i>Jeux d'eau</i>, <i>Miroirs</i> and <i>Gaspard de la Nuit</i>, demand considerable virtuosity from the performer, and his orchestral music, including <i>Daphnis et Chloé</i> and his arrangement of Modest Mussorgsky's <i>Pictures at an Exhibition</i>, uses tonal color and variety of sound and instrumentation very effectively.]]></wTeaser>

						<wTeaser><![CDATA[<b>Dmitri Dmitriyevich Shostakovich</b> (; &ndash; 9 August 1975) was a Russian composer of the Soviet period. <br />After a period influenced by Prokofiev and Stravinsky (e.g. in his Symphony No. 1 of 1927), Shostakovich developed a hybrid of styles as exemplified in his opera <i>Lady Macbeth of the Mtsensk District</i> (1934). This frequently juxtaposed a wide variety of trends within a single work, such as the neo-classical style (showing the influence of Stravinsky) and a form of post-romantic style (after Mahler). His unique approach to tonality involved the use of modal scales and some astringent neo-classical harmonies à la Hindemith and Prokofiev. His music frequently includes sharp contrasts and elements of the grotesque.]]></wTeaser>

						<wTeaser><![CDATA[<b>Achille-Claude Debussy</b> (August 22, 1862 &ndash; March 25, 1918) was a French composer. Along with Maurice Ravel, he is considered one of the most prominent figures working within the field of Impressionist music, though he himself intensely disliked the term when applied to his compositions. Debussy is not only among the most important of all French composers; he was also a central figure in all European music at the turn of the twentieth century. His music is noted for its sensory component and how it is not often formed around one key or pitch. Oftentimes Debussy's work reflected the activities or turbulence in his own life.<br />Debussy's music virtually defines the transition from late-Romantic music to twentieth century modernist music.]]></wTeaser>
